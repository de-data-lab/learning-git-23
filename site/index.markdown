# Welcome! 

During this exercise, you'll use version control and [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to build out a simple fellow profile page. You will practice key steps of the Git workflow such as cloning repositories, creating issues, making pull requests, and merging. 

## Prerequisites

1. You must have Git [installed on your machine](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
2. You must have been added as a collaborator on the [Github repository](https://github.com/de-data-lab/learning-git-23).

# Building Your Profile Page

## The Workflow

At the Lab, we typically use a modified version of [Git Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow). The idea behind this workflow is that every new feature/fix should be 1) documented in a [Github issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue), 2) developed in a separate branch based on the issue, and then 3) merged into `main` via a pull request. Let's get started! 
  
 <br/>

### 1. Clone the Github repo 

Go to the [Github repository](https://github.com/de-data-lab/learning-git-23) and clone it to your machine: `git clone [REPO_URL]`. You will find the URL under **Code** at the top of the repo. Where possible, we recommend using SSH to clone Git repositories. 

### 2. Open an issue on the repo 

Next, you'll create an issue to tell everyone that you are adding your profile to the website. An issue should: 
* Have a descriptive title 
* Include a comment that describes what needs to be done 
* Be assigned to a member of the repo (or to yourself)
